# Data-Wrangling-and-Management-WIth-R-Assignments
This is a repository that contains assignments that I completed for my Data Wrangling and Management With R course, which involves a lot of cleaning and working with data using R to be able to build visualizations.

- Week 1: This assignment is just some practice on basic plotting using ggplot. 
- Week 2: This assignment involves using the five main functions of the tidyverse package(filter(), select(), mutate(), group_by(), and summarize()) to work with data. 
- Week 3: This assignment involves working with mutating joins on the gapminder dataset.
- Week 4: This assignment also uses mutating joins, but also includes filtering joins, as well as working with dates using the lubridate package. It also includes reading different types of files, as well as loading packages. 
- Week 5: This assignment is more practice on previous topics, and also adds pivoting datasets using the pivot_wider() and pivot_longer() functions, as well as using regex to extract and detect strings. 
- Week 6: This assignment is more practice on pivoting data, regex, and previous topics. 
- Week 7(Part 1): This is practice on making your own Rmd file and working with it. 
- Week 7(Part 2): This assignment is practice on cleaning and preparing data using Spotify charts data. 
- Week 8: This assignment involves using the case_when() function, using map functions, tidying data, and a little more advanced plotting using ggplot.
- Week 9: This assignment involves obtaining data from web scraping, and working with that data to make it usable. 
- Week 10: This assignment is more practice with web scraping, as well as using API's to obtain data.
